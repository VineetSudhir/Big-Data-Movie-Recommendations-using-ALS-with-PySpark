Big Data Movie Recommendations using ALS recommendation model with hyperparameter tuning

Reduced Sparsity of dataset by sampling from Big dataset
Test among multiple combinations of values for hyperparameters 

Validation error using big dataset is approximately 389% 
Validation error after reducing sparsity of big dataset is approximately 95.6%
Validation error after choosing best hyperparameters is approximately 81.7% 

best hyper-parameters: k = 12, regularization = 0.1, iterations = 30, validation error = 0.8174323040709253
